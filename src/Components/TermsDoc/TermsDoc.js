        By signing up for this webpage, you are herby agreeing that we may use
        and sell any and all usernames and passwords. We understand the
        usernames and passwords entered by users are used across all accounts
        they have. Maybe I can even sign onto your Netflix with what you enter
        since that's getting way too expensive these days. The screen limit they
        place has gotten rediculous as well. Although I really do want to watch
        that new show everyone's been talking about. Something about a National
        Park? I don't know, Harrison Ford made an appearance and I like
        everything he's in. That way I can have something more substancial to
        talk about with my father-in-law at their Fourth-of-July party and maybe
        distract him from asking "how's that coding thing going?" or God forbid
        politics. So do me a huge favour and submit them before it's too late.
